# Code for producing figures to Stable and expressive recurrent vision models


- Run `python pf_performance.py` to get all pathfinder results (figure 3 in the main text; figures S3, S4, S5, and S6 in SI).
- Run `python state_space_hgru.py` to get the state space results for the hGRU. The other state_space_* scripts correspond to SI figures S1 and S2.
- Run `python plot_coco.py` to get COCO-related figures (figure 4 in the main text, and figures S7 and S8 in the SI).
- Run `python plot_predictions.py` to plot some coco predictions (used in main text and SI).
